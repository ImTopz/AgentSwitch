/** A list the agent draws on its own screen and waits on — Codex's `/model` (its models, then how hard each thinks),
 *  Claude Code's or Codex's question whether to trust a folder, any menu of theirs: rows, one of them marked as where
 *  the selection stands. A screen that shows the record offers the same rows; taking one moves the selection there with
 *  the arrow keys and enters it, as in the terminal (docs/simple-view-v0.md §5.11; 2026-10-08, user: /model直接在简略
 *  视图里出一个列表让我可以点就行了，逻辑和和在cli一致).
 *
 *  Two shapes are read. Numbered rows (`› 1. Trust and continue` / `  2. Quit`), as before. And rows without numbers
 *  (`❯ No, exit` / `  Yes, I trust this folder`), which is how Claude Code 2.1.299 asks about a folder: these are a
 *  list only with the line under them that says how to take one (`Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel`), since a mark and
 *  a few words is also what a prompt with something typed after it looks like (2026-11-10, user: 第一次进入某个文件夹
 *  的需要选是否信任文件夹，这个时候简略模式无法正常显示; seen with scripts/trust_prompt_probe.ts).
 *
 *  `title` is what is asked: the paragraph above the rows that asks something, else the nearest. `text` is everything
 *  the screen says above the rows, when that is more than the title — a folder's question is several paragraphs, and
 *  the last line of one of them (`decision will be saved.`) said nothing. */
